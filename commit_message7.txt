refactor: Remove duplicate view migrations and cleanup database

DELETED DUPLICATE MIGRATIONS:
- 15a: Duplicate products view (superseded by 15)
- 15b: Duplicate document_products/manufacturers views (superseded by 15)
- 16a: Duplicate links view with RULES (superseded by 31 with TRIGGERS)
- 17: DEPRECATED consolidated features
- 20: DEPRECATED chunks view (superseded by 20c)
- 26: Old vw_embeddings (superseded by 35)

MIGRATION 82 - Database Cleanup:
- Drop old RULES from deleted migrations
- Drop deprecated search_analytics view
- Clean up all duplicate database objects

DOCUMENTATION:
- Added VIEW_AUDIT.md: Complete audit of duplicate views
- Added TABLES_USED_IN_CODE.md: Which tables/views are used in code

RESULT:
- Cleaner migration structure
- No duplicate views
- Modern TRIGGERS instead of old RULES
- All code still works (uses table names, not view names)

This is a major cleanup that removes 6 duplicate/deprecated migrations.
