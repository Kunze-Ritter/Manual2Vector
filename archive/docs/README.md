## Why Archive?

Documentation is archived rather than deleted to:
1. Preserve historical context and decision-making rationale
2. Allow rollback or reference to previous approaches if needed
3. Maintain audit trail of project evolution
4. Provide learning material for understanding project history

## Active Documentation

For current, active documentation, see:
- `/MASTER-TODO.md` - Consolidated project-wide TODO list
- `/README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `/DOCKER_SETUP.md` - Docker deployment guide
- `/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - Database schema documentation
- `/docs/` - Active documentation directory

## Restoration

If you need to restore or reference archived documentation:

1. **For Reference Only:** Simply read the files in their archive location
2. **For Restoration:** Copy files back to their original locations
3. **For Context:** Check git history for original commit metadata

**Note:** The MASTER-TODO.md contains consolidated tasks from all superseded files, so restoration should only be necessary for historical context, not for active task tracking.
