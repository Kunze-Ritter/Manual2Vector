refactor: Standardize all views to vw_ prefix

MAJOR REFACTORING - Consistent View Naming:

CODE CHANGES:
- Refactored ALL .table() calls to use vw_ prefix
- Updated: agent_api.py, search_api.py, app.py
- Updated: document_processor.py, manufacturer_utils.py, oem_sync.py
- Updated: database_service.py, quality_check_service.py
- Updated: video_enrichment_service.py, and more

MIGRATION 83:
- Drop all non-vw_ views (documents, products, manufacturers, etc.)
- Keep only vw_ prefixed views
- Clean, consistent naming convention

BENEFITS:
- Clear distinction: vw_ = view, no prefix = table
- No duplicate views (removed ~10 redundant views)
- Easier to understand database structure
- Consistent across entire codebase

BREAKING CHANGE:
- Old code using table('documents') will break
- Must use table('vw_documents') now
- All code in this repo already updated

This is a major cleanup that removes ALL view duplicates and establishes
a clear naming convention: vw_ prefix = view.
