fix: Critical error code extraction fix and cleanup

CRITICAL FIX - Error Code Solutions:
- Fixed continuation line threshold: 10 -> 3 chars
- This fixes the 18-character truncation bug
- Solutions now capture full text including short words
- Improved section header detection

Database Cleanup Script:
- Added batch deletion (100 IDs per batch)
- Added images, links, processing_queue tables
- Skip non-existent tables gracefully
- Handles large datasets without timeout

Code Cleanup:
- Removed duplicate migration 16a (superseded by 31)
- Migration 31 has proper triggers for links/videos
- Cleaner migration structure

This fixes the critical bug where error code solutions were truncated to 18 characters.
