feat: Add fallback support for old Ollama API

LLM extractor now supports both old and new Ollama API:
- Tries new API (/api/chat) first
- Falls back to old API (/api/generate) on 405 error
- Works on both old and new Ollama versions

This ensures compatibility across different PCs and Ollama versions.
