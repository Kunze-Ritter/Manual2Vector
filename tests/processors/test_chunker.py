Unit Tests for SmartChunker

This module provides comprehensive unit testing for the SmartChunker component,
covering chunk creation, size management, overlap handling, metadata generation,
and various chunking strategies.

Test Categories:
1. Basic Chunking Tests
2. Chunk Size Management Tests  
3. Overlap Handling Tests
4. Metadata Generation Tests
5. Edge Cases Tests
6. Configuration Tests

All tests use the fixtures from conftest.py for consistent mock objects and test data.
