If part_name is None in most tests, the problem is:
1. Part number appears alone on a line (Format 4)
2. No text after part number on same line
3. Next line is too short (< 10 chars) or empty

SOLUTION:
- Improve pattern matching
- Look for part names in surrounding context
- Use LLM to extract part names if pattern fails
