# 🚀 KRAI - Knowledge Retrieval and Intelligence

Advanced Multimodal AI Document Processing Pipeline with Local-First Architecture and Vector Search

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker - Recommended)

### ⚡ One-Command Setup (Linux/macOS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunze-Ritter/Manual2Vector
cd Manual2Vector
./setup.sh  # Generates all 15+ secrets, RSA keys, and passwords automatically
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up --build -d
```

### ⚡ One-Command Setup with Firecrawl (Advanced Web Scraping)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunze-Ritter/Manual2Vector
cd Manual2Vector
./setup.sh  # Generates all 15+ secrets, RSA keys, and passwords automatically
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-firecrawl.yml up --build -d
```

### ⚡ One-Command Setup (Windows)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Kunze-Ritter/Manual2Vector
cd Manual2Vector
# Recommended: PowerShell (Windows 10/11)
.\setup.ps1  # Modern, secure, and maintainable

# Alternative: Batch (legacy fallback for older Windows)
setup.bat
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up --build -d
```

### ⚡ One-Command Setup with Firecrawl (Windows)

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/Kunze-Ritter/Manual2Vector
cd Manual2Vector
# Recommended: PowerShell (Windows 10/11)
.\setup.ps1  # Modern, secure, and maintainable

# Alternative: Batch (legacy fallback for older Windows)
setup.bat
docker-compose -f docker-compose.with-firecrawl.yml up --build -d
```

**🎉 That's it! Your system is running!**

### 🔄 Quick Start from Scratch (Clean Environment)

If you need to completely reset your Docker environment or start fresh:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./scripts/docker-clean-setup.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\docker-clean-setup.ps1
```

This script performs:
- ✅ Stops all containers with `docker-compose down` 
- ✅ Removes all KRAI volumes (postgres, minio, ollama, redis, laravel)
- ✅ Prunes Docker networks
- ✅ Starts fresh containers with `docker-compose up -d` 
- ✅ Waits 60 seconds for service initialization
- ✅ Verifies seed data (14 manufacturers, 4 retry policies)

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` - Success: All steps completed, seed data verified
- `1` - Failure: One or more steps failed

> **⚠️ Warning:** This script removes all Docker volumes and data. Use only when you need a completely fresh start.

> **📖 Detailed Documentation:** See [DOCKER_SETUP.md - Clean Setup Scripts](DOCKER_SETUP.md#-clean-setup-scripts) for comprehensive usage examples and troubleshooting.

### 🚀 Complete Docker Setup & Validation (All-in-One)

For a comprehensive setup that includes clean environment reset, health checks, integration tests, and persistency validation:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./scripts/full-docker-setup.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\full-docker-setup.ps1
```

**What this script does:**
1. ✅ **Clean Setup** - Resets Docker environment (stops containers, removes volumes, starts fresh)
2. ✅ **Health Check** - Validates all services (PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Laravel, MinIO, Ollama)
3. ✅ **Integration Tests** - Tests service-to-service connectivity
4. ✅ **Persistency Tests** - Verifies data survives container restarts

**Duration:** ~8-10 minutes (depending on system performance)

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` - All steps completed successfully
- `1` - Completed with warnings (system functional but degraded)
- `2` - Critical errors detected (manual intervention required)

**Options:**
```bash
# Skip clean setup (faster, for quick validation)
./scripts/full-docker-setup.sh --skip-clean

# Skip integration tests
./scripts/full-docker-setup.sh --skip-integration

# Save logs to file
./scripts/full-docker-setup.sh --log-file setup.log
```

**When to use:**
- 🆕 Initial project setup
- 🔄 After major configuration changes
- 🐛 Troubleshooting environment issues
- ✅ Pre-deployment validation
- 📊 CI/CD pipeline integration

> **💡 Tip:** For faster validation without data reset, use `./scripts/docker-health-check.sh` followed by `./scripts/docker-integration-tests.sh`

> **📖 Detailed Documentation:** See [DOCKER_SETUP.md - Full Docker Setup](DOCKER_SETUP.md#-full-docker-setup-orchestrator) for comprehensive usage and troubleshooting.

> **Dashboard Interface:** KRAI uses **Laravel/Filament** as the sole dashboard interface at http://localhost:80. This provides visual pipeline management, document processing control, and real-time monitoring capabilities. See [Laravel Dashboard](#-laravel-dashboard) below for verification report and operations runbook.

**Access your services:**

- 🖥️ **Laravel Dashboard**: `http://localhost:80`
- ⚙️ **API**: `http://localhost:8000`
- 📊 **API Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- 🏥 **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- 💾 **MinIO Console**: `http://localhost:9001` (credentials from `.env`)
  - Setup scripts may randomize MinIO credentials—check your `.env` for the current values.
- 🔥 **Firecrawl API**: `http://localhost:9002` (nur mit Firecrawl-Setup)

**🔐 What the setup script does:**
- ✅ Generates 15+ cryptographically secure passwords
- ✅ Creates RSA 2048-bit keypair for JWT authentication
- ✅ Consolidates all configuration into single `.env` file (10 sections)
- ✅ Validates all required variables are set
- ✅ Shows generated credentials for your reference

**📋 Manual configuration required:**
- YouTube API Key (optional): Get from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Cloudflare Tunnel Token (optional): Get from [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)

### 📋 Manual Setup (Alternative)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kunze-Ritter/Manual2Vector
cd Manual2Vector
cp .env.example .env  # Contains 10 sections with 60+ configuration variables
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up --build -d
```

# ⚠️ Warning: Manual setup requires editing 15+ secrets - use setup.sh instead!

**Windows Setup Scripts:**

- **setup.ps1** (Recommended): Modern PowerShell script for Windows 10/11
  - Uses .NET Crypto APIs for secure secret generation
  - Shorter and more maintainable than setup.bat (299 vs. 744 lines)
  - Requires PowerShell 5.0+ (included in Windows 10/11)
  - Fallback to OpenSSL if .NET APIs unavailable

- **setup.bat** (Legacy): Batch script for older Windows versions

## 🎯 Overview

KRAI is a comprehensive multimodal AI system that automatically extracts, analyzes, and indexes technical documents with advanced features including hierarchical structure detection, SVG vector graphics processing, and intelligent multimodal search. Built with a **local-first architecture** using PostgreSQL and MinIO, KRAI provides complete control over your data while offering optional cloud migration capabilities when needed.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔄 Stage-Based Processing Pipeline

- **16-Stage Modular Architecture** - Granular control over document processing
- **Stage Orchestration** - UPLOAD → TEXT_EXTRACTION → TABLE_EXTRACTION → SVG_PROCESSING → IMAGE_PROCESSING → VISUAL_EMBEDDING → LINK_EXTRACTION → VIDEO_ENRICHMENT (optional) → CHUNK_PREPROCESSING → CLASSIFICATION → METADATA_EXTRACTION → PARTS_EXTRACTION → SERIES_DETECTION → STORAGE → EMBEDDING → SEARCH_INDEXING
- **Individual Stage Execution** - Run specific stages on-demand via CLI or API
- **Smart Processing** - Skip completed stages and resume from failures
- **Real-time Status Tracking** - Monitor progress of each stage independently
- **Error Isolation** - One stage failure doesn't stop the entire pipeline
- **Reference**: `docs/processor/PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed architecture

### 🔁 Error Handling and Resilience

- **Retry engine** – Hybrid sync/async retries with exponential backoff; transient vs permanent error classification (HTTP 5xx/408/429, connection/timeout → retry; 4xx/validation/auth → no retry).
- **Dual-target error logging** – Errors written to `krai_system.pipeline_errors` and structured JSON logs; correlation IDs for retry chains.
- **Idempotency** – SHA-256 completion markers in `krai_system.stage_completion_markers` to avoid duplicate work when re-running stages.
- **Advisory locks** – PostgreSQL advisory locks prevent concurrent retries for the same document/stage.
- **Correlation ID format** – `{request_id}.stage_{stage_name}.retry_{retry_attempt}` (e.g. `req_a3f2e8d1.stage_image_processing.retry_1`) for tracing retries.
- **Retry policy configuration** – Per-service policies in `krai_system.retry_policies` (firecrawl, database, ollama, minio); code-level defaults if DB unavailable.
- **Verification:** [Verification Report Error Handling](VERIFICATION_REPORT_ERROR_HANDLING.md) · **Operations:** [Operational Runbook: Error Handling](docs/OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK_ERROR_HANDLING.md)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key configuration options in `.env` (10 sections, 60+ variables):

```bash
# Database Configuration (PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql
DATABASE_HOST=krai-postgres
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=krai
DATABASE_USER=krai_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=<generated-password>
DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL=postgresql://krai_user:<password>@krai-postgres:5432/krai

# Object Storage (MinIO)
OBJECT_STORAGE_TYPE=s3
OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://krai-minio:9000
OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY=<generated-password>

# AI Service (Ollama)
OLLAMA_URL=http://krai-ollama:11434
```

> **Note:** The backend uses `OLLAMA_URL` for AI service communication. All passwords are generated automatically by setup scripts.

### .env.local Example

For host-based runs, you can override specific configuration options in `.env.local`. Create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env.local.example`:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then, update the necessary variables, such as `DATABASE_HOST` and `OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`, to point to `localhost`:

```bash
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
OBJECT_STORAGE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
```

### Setup Script Comparison

| Feature | setup.sh | setup.ps1 | setup.bat |
|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Platform | Linux/macOS | Windows 10/11 | Windows (all) |
| Lines of Code | 855 | 299 | 744 |
| Crypto API | OpenSSL | .NET + OpenSSL | PowerShell + OpenSSL |
| Maintainability | ✅ High | ✅ High | ⚠️ Medium |
| Recommended | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Legacy only |

**Recommendation:**
- **Linux/macOS:** Use `./setup.sh` 
- **Windows 10/11:** Use `.\setup.ps1` (PowerShell)
- **Older Windows:** Use `setup.bat` as fallback

### Environment Validation

Validate your `.env` file before starting Docker:

```bash
# Check all required variables are set
python scripts/validate_env.py

# Verbose output with detailed checks
python scripts/validate_env.py --verbose

# Treat warnings as errors (strict mode)
python scripts/validate_env.py --strict
```

### Service Verification

After starting Docker, verify all services are healthy:

```bash
# Check all Docker services
python scripts/verify_local_setup.py

# Check specific service
python scripts/verify_local_setup.py --service postgresql
```

### Custom Models

Configure custom AI models:

```bash
# Text Classification Model
AI_TEXT_MODEL=llama3.2:latest

# Embeddings Model
AI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text:latest

# Vision Model
AI_VISION_MODEL=llava:7b
```

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### API Integration

```python
import requests

# Health check
response = requests.get('http://localhost:8000/health')

# Document upload
with open('document.pdf', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/documents', files={'file': f})

# Semantic search
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/search', json={
    'query': 'error code 900.01',
    'limit': 10
})
```

### Docker Management

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml down

# Update containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up --build -d
```
