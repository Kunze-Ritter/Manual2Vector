print("""
Dependencies found indicate accessories that are ALWAYS used together.
This could mean:
1. One accessory REQUIRES the other (e.g., Finisher requires Relay Unit)
2. They are part of a standard package
3. They are physically connected

Mutual exclusivity indicates accessories that NEVER appear together.
This could mean:
1. They occupy the same physical space
2. They serve the same function (only one needed)
3. They are incompatible for technical reasons
